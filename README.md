# GuessTheText
a (safe?) words guessing game made in C

How it's played:
=
One enters a text
The other guesses it by either 
inputing a series of letters (including space)/numbers or one of them each time
by default you can only do 10 mistakes

Note : duplicated guess will be counted a mistake.

Enjoy!
